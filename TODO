BSON
----
+ on insert/update: reject keys that start with "$" or "."
+ data support for common mongo "$symbols"
+ convert from/to json
+ tie in with native regex like python does?
  - on outgoing uncompile?
  - on incoming automatically compile
+ more time convertibles
+ map operations for BsonDoc

MongoDB
-------
+ support full level 0
  - database command support ??
  - handle query errors
  - hint, explain, count, $where
  - database profiling: set/get profiling level, get profiling info
  - validate a collection in a database ??
  - pair mode connection
  - operations on database objects
    * getName
    * getCollection
    * dropCollection
    * executeCommand
    * dropDatabase (erase)
  - database admin
    * getAdmin
    * getProfilingLevel
    * setProfilingLevel
    * getProfilingInfo
    * validateCollection
  - collection
    * modify
    * replace
    * repsert
    * getCount()
    * getCount(query)
  - index operations
    * createIndex
    * dropIndex
    * dropIndexes
    * getIndexInformation
  - misc operations
    * explain
    * getOptions
    * getName
    * close
  - cursor object
    * hasMore
  optional:
  - automatic reconnection
  - buffer pooling
  - advanced connection management (master-server, replica pair, Option_SlaveOk)
  - Tailable cursor support
+ support safe operations
+ auto-reconnection
+ auto-destoy connection (how?/when?)
+ pymongo returns the new ObjectId(s) on insert
+ don't read into cursor until needed, but have cursor send getMore before
  it is actually out of docs (so network is finished by the time we're ready
  to consume more)
+ support a LIMITed quickFind

Misc
----
+ learn more about haskelldb, anything we can learn from there
+ go through pymongo api and figure out what parts to adopt (also look
  at other languages?)
  - database_names()
  - collection_names()
+ support for aggricated commands like listing collections
+ kill prefix on data types "eg QO_*"?
+ javascript
+ tailable cursor support
  - only close cursor when cursorID is 0
  - have to create loop that sleeps and retries
  - lazy list support
+ error handling?
+ concurrency (share connection?)
+ is there a garbage collector hook that will let us free cursors and connections?
