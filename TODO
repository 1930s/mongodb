TODO
====

BSON
----
+ support something like toSql (convert a haskell type to bson)
  - write convertible instances
+ on insert/update: reject keys that start with "$" or "."
+ data support for common mongo "$symbols"

MongoDB
-------
+ support safe operations
+ auto-reconnection
+ seemless iterator (using lazy lists?) (unsafeInterleaveIO)
  - hdbc has a fetchRow that returns a Maybe and auto-closes their statement
    once everything's been read
  - hdbc has a fetchAllRows that builds up a lazy list using fetchRow (so
    it auto-closes the statement)
+ destoy cursor (how?/when?)

Misc
----
+ learn more about haskelldb, anything we can learn from there
+ go through pymongo api and figure out what parts to adopt (also look
  at other languages?)
+ support for aggricated commands like listing collections
